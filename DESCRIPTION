Description: The tdROC package facilitates the estimation of time-dependent ROC 
    (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and the Area Under the time-dependent 
    ROC Curve (AUC) in the context of survival data, accommodating scenarios with 
    right censored data and the option to account for competing risks. In addition 
    to the ROC/AUC estimation, the package also estimates time-dependent Brier score and 
    survival difference. Confidence intervals of various estimated quantities can be 
    obtained from bootstrap. The package also offers plotting functions for visualizing 
    time-dependent ROC curves.
